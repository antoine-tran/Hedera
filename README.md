Hedera
======

Hedera is a framework to facilitate the processing of big versioned
document collections  using Hadoop framework. It provides
customized InputFormat for accessing data in parallel in standard
MapReduce workflows. It also has new mechanism of extracting and
transforming while loading (versus the traditional Extraction,
Transformation, Loading or ETL) to reduce the IO burden when passing
large amounts of data through a cluster. At the moment, Hedera can be
used in Hadoop Streaming to enable rapid development using different
languages (Java, Python, C, etc.) , and it also supports Pig with
a number of User-defined functions (UDFs). Free for research and educational purpose
