Its name must have corresponded closely to the [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]] or [[Arabic script|Arabic]] aleph.\r\n\r\n{| cellspacing=\"10\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"background-color: white; float: right;\"\r\n|- align=\"center\"\r\n|[[File:BlackletterA-01.png|Blackletter A]]<br />[[Blackletter]] A\r\n|[[File:UncialA-01.svg|Uncial A]]<br />[[Uncial script|Uncial]] A\r\n|[[File:Acap.svg|Another Capital A]]<br />Another Blackletter A&nbsp;\r\n|- align=\"center\"\r\n|[[File:ModernRomanA-01.svg|64 px|Modern Roman A]]<br />Modern Roman A\r\n|[[File:Modern Italic A.svg|64 px|Modern Italic A]]<br />Modern Italic A\r\n|[[File:Modern Script A.svg|64 px|Modern Script A]]<br />Modern script A\r\n|}\r\nWhen the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] adopted the alphabet, they had no use for the [[glottal stop]]\u2014the first [[phoneme]] of the Phoenician pronunciation of the letter, and the sound that the letter denoted in [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] and other [[Semitic languages]]\u2014so they used an adaptation of the sign to represent the vowel {{IPA|/a/}}, and gave it the similar name of [[alpha]]. In the earliest Greek inscriptions after the [[Greek Dark Ages]], dating to the 8th century BC, the letter rests upon its side, but in the [[Greek alphabet]] of later times it generally resembles the modern capital letter, although many local varieties can be distinguished by the shortening of one leg, or by the angle at which the cross line is set.\r\n\r\nThe [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] brought the Greek alphabet to their civilization in the [[Italian Peninsula]] and left the letter unchanged. The Romans later adopted the [[Old Italic script|Etruscan alphabet]] to write the [[Latin|Latin language]], and the resulting letter was preserved in the [[Latin script|Latin alphabet]] used to write many languages, including English.\r\n\r\n===Typographic variants===\r\n[[File:LowercaseA.svg|right|thumb|200|Typographic variants include a double-storey '''a''' and single-storey '''\u0251'''.]]\r\nDuring Roman times, there were many variations on the letter \"A\". First was the monumental or lapidary style, which was used when inscribing on stone or other \"permanent\" mediums. For perishable surfaces, what was used for everyday or utilitarian purposes, a [[cursive]] style was used. Due to the \"perishable\" nature of the surfaces, these examples are not as prevalent as the monumental. This perishable style was called cursive and numerous variations have survived, such as [[letter case|majuscule]] cursive, [[letter case|minuscule]] cursive, and semicursive minuscule. There were also variants that were intermediate between the monumental and the cursive. The known variants include the early [[Uncial script#Half-uncial|semi-uncial]], the uncial, and the later semi-uncial.<ref name=Americana>{{harvnb|Diringer|2000|p=1}}</ref>\r\n\r\nAt the termination of the [[Roman Empire]] (5th century AD), several variants of the cursive minuscule appeared through Western Europe. Among these were the semicursive minuscule of [[Italy]], the [[Merovingian script]] in France, the [[Visigothic script]] in Spain, and the [[Insular script|Insular]] or Anglo-Irish semi-uncial or Anglo-Saxon majuscule, of Great Britain. By the 9th century, the [[Carolingian minuscule|Caroline script]], which was very similar to the present-day form, was the principal form used in book-making, before the advent of the printing press. This form was derived through a combining of prior forms.<ref name=Americana/>\r\n\r\n15th-century Italy saw the formation of the two variants that are known today. These variants, the ''Italics'' and ''Roman'' forms, were derived from the Caroline Script version. The Italics form used in most current [[handwriting]] consists of a circle and vertical stroke ({{Unicode|\"\u0251\"}}), called [[Latin alpha]] or \"script a\". This slowly developed from the fifth-century form resembling the Greek letter [[tau]] in the hands of medieval Irish and English writers.<ref name=\"Britannica\"/> Most printed material uses the Roman form consisting of a small loop with an arc over it ({{Unicode|\"a\"}}).<ref name=Americana/> Both derive from the majuscule (capital) form. In Greek handwriting, it was common to join the left leg and horizontal stroke into a single loop, as demonstrated by the uncial version shown. Many fonts then made the right leg vertical. In some of these, the [[serif]] that began the right leg stroke developed into an arc, resulting in the printed form, while in others it was dropped, resulting in the modern handwritten form.\r\n\r\n==Use in English==\r\nIn [[English orthography]], the letter A currently represents six different vowel sounds: A by itself frequently denotes the [[near-open front unrounded vowel]] ({{IPA|/\u00E6/}}) as in ''pad''; the [[open back unrounded vowel]] ({{IPA|/\u0251\u02D0/}}) as in ''father'', its original, Latin and Greek, sound;<ref name=Coll/> a closer, further fronted sound as in \"hare\", which developed as the sound progressed from \"father\" to \"ace\";<ref name=\"Britannica\"/> in concert with a later orthographic vowel, the diphthong {{IPA|/e\u026A/}} as in ''ace'' and ''major'', due to effects of the [[Great Vowel Shift]]; the more rounded form in \"water\" or its closely related cousin, found in \"was\".<ref name=\"Britannica\"/>\r\n\r\nThe double \"a\" sequence is not a native English combination; however it occurs in some foreign words such as ''Aaron'' and ''aardvark''.<ref>{{harvnb|Gelb|Whiting|1998|p=45}}</ref>\r\n\r\n\"A\" is the third-most-commonly used letter in English (after \"E\" and \"T\"),<ref>{{harvnb|Anon|2004}}</ref> and the second most common in Spanish and French. In one study, on average, about 3.68% of letters used in English tend to be 'a', while the number is 6.22% in Spanish and 3.95% in French.<ref>{{harvnb|Anon|2006}}</ref>\r\n\r\n==Use in other languages==\r\nIn most languages that use the Latin alphabet, A denotes an open unrounded vowel: {{IPA|/[[Open front unrounded vowel|a]]/}}, {{IPA|/[[Open central unrounded vowel|\u00E4]]/}}, or {{IPA|/[[Open back unrounded vowel|\u0251]]/}}. An exception is [[Saanich dialect|Saanich]], in which A (and [[\u00C1]]) stands for a [[close-mid front unrounded vowel]] {{IPA|/e/}}.\r\n\r\n==Use in mathematics, logic and science==\r\n{{main|A (disambiguation)}}\r\nIn [[algebra]], the letter \"A\" along with other letters at the beginning of the alphabet is used to represent known quantities, whereas the letters at the end of the alphabet (x,y,z) are used to denote unknown quantities.\r\n\r\nIn [[geometry]], capital A, B, C etc. are used to denote [[Line segment|segment]]s, [[line (geometry)|line]]s, [[Line (geometry)#Ray|rays]], etc.<ref name=Americana/> A capital A is also typically used as one of the letters to represent an angle in a [[triangle]], the lowercase a representing the side opposite angle A.<ref name=Coll/>\r\n\r\nIn [[logic]], A is used to signify the [[Categorical proposition|universal affirmative]].\r\n\r\nIn [[physics]], A is the [[SI]] unit symbol for [[Ampere]].\r\n\r\nIn phonetic and phonemic notation:\r\n*in the [[help:IPA|International Phonetic Alphabet]], {{IPA|[a]}} is used for the [[open front unrounded vowel]], {{IPA|[\u00E4]}} is used for the [[open central unrounded vowel]] and {{IPA|[\u0251]}} is used for the [[open back unrounded vowel]].\r\n*in [[X-SAMPA]], [a] is used for the [[open front unrounded vowel]] and [A] is used for the [[open back unrounded vowel]].\r\n\r\n==Other uses==\r\n{{main|A (disambiguation)}}\r\n\"A\" is often used to denote something or someone of a better or more prestigious quality or status: A-, A or A+, the best grade that can be assigned by teachers for students' schoolwork; \"A grade\" for clean restaurants; [[A-list]] celebrities, etc. Such associations can have a [[motivation|motivating]] effect, as exposure to the letter A has been found to improve performance, when compared with other letters.<ref>{{harvnb|British Psychological Society|2010}}</ref>\r\n\r\nA is a common symbol of school and basic phonetics in the US, along with [[B]] and [[C]].\r\n\r\nFinally, the letter A is used to denote size, as in a narrow size shoe,<ref name=Coll/> or a small cup size in a [[brassiere]].\r\n\r\n==Related letters and other similar characters==\r\n[[File:A-small glyphs.svg|thumb|140px|Different [[glyphs]] of the lowercase letter A.]]\r\n* \u0391 \u03B1 : [[Alpha|Greek letter alpha]]\r\n* \u0410 \u0430 : [[A (Cyrillic)|Cyrillic letter A]]\r\n* {{Unicode|\u2C6D \u0251}} : [[Latin alpha|Latin letter alpha / script A]]\r\n* {{Unicode|\u0250}} : a turned lowercase letter A, used by the International Phonetic Alphabet for the [[near-open central vowel]]\r\n* {{Unicode|\u2200}} : a turned capital letter A, used in [[predicate logic]] to specify [[universal quantification]] (\"for all\")\r\n* <big>\u00AA</big> : an [[ordinal indicator]]\r\n* \u00C6 \u00E6 : [[\u00C6|Latin ''AE'']] ligature\r\n* \u00C5 \u00E5 : [[\u00C5|A letter used in various Scandinavian (and other) languages]]\r\n\r\n==Computing codes==\r\n{{charmap\r\n| 0041 | 0061 | name1 = Latin Capital Letter A | name2 =   Latin Small Letter A\r\n| map1 = [[EBCDIC]] family | map1char1 = C1 | map1char2 = 81\r\n| map2 = [[ASCII]] <sup>1</sup> | map2char1 = 41 | map2char2 = 61\r\n}}\r\n: <sup>1</sup> {{midsize|Also for encodings based on ASCII, including the DOS, Windows, ISO-8859 and Macintosh families of encodings.}}\r\n\r\n==Other representations==\r\n{{Letter other reps\r\n|NATO=Alpha<!--don't change to official \"alfa\" until Commons images are moved to this spelling, or redirects are set up, as otherwise the table does not display the semaphore and flag images-->\r\n|Morse=\u00B7\u2013\r\n|Character=A1\r\n|Braille=\u2801\r\n}}\r\n\r\n==Notes==\r\n{{reflist|group=nb}}\r\n\r\n==Footnotes==\r\n{{reflist|2}}\r\n\r\n==References==\r\n* {{cite web | author = Anon | year = 2004 | url = http://www.math.cornell.edu/~mec/2003-2004/cryptography/subs/frequencies.html | title = English Letter Frequency | accessdate = 28 May 2014 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/6Put1etCm | archivedate = 28 May 2014 | publisher = Cornell University | work = Math Explorer's Club | ref = harv }}\r\n\r\n* {{cite web | author = Anon | year = 2006 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070125220315/http://starbase.trincoll.edu/~crypto/resources/LetFreq.html | url=http://starbase.trincoll.edu/~crypto/resources/LetFreq.html |archivedate=January 25, 2007 | title = Percentages of Letter frequencies per Thousand words | website = Trinity College | accessdate = 11 May 2015 | ref = harv }}\r\n\r\n* {{cite web | author = British Psychological Society| url = http://www.sciencealert.com.au/news/20100903-20689.html | title = Letters Affect Exam Results | date = 9 March 2010 | website = Science Alert | accessdate = 28 May 2014 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/6PutAuaJz | archivedate = 28 May 2014 | ref = harv }}\r\n\r\n* {{cite encyclopedia | last = Diringer | first = David | editor-last = Bayer | editor-first = Patricia | encyclopedia = Encyclopedia Americana | title = A | edition = First | year = 2000  | publisher = Grolier Incorporated | volume = I: A-Anjou | location = Danbury, CT | isbn = 0-7172-0133-3 | ref = harv }}\r\n\r\n* {{cite encyclopedia | last1 = Gelb | first1 = I.
