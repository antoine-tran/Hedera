Hedera
======

A Hadoop software toolkit for working with very large versioned document collections such as Wikipedia Revision History. [Project website here](http://antoine-tran.github.io/hedera)

#### Disclaimer ####
The tool is currently pretty much in active development phase :), meaning that it can
go through several updates per day, with new functionalities added or modified / improved.
I am trying to make it stable every day, but if you find any issues regarding installation,
running code, please drop me a message to: ttran (at) L3S (dot) de. Danke sch√∂n !
